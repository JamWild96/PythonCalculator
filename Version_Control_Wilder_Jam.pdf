Version Control System Overview

Version Control System Used: GitHub

GitHub, a distributed version control system built on top of Git, has been utilized for managing version control in the project.

Advantages of GitHub
	1.	Distributed Nature: GitHub allows collaboration among multiple team members, where everyone has a full version of the repository, including its history.
	2.	Branching and Merging: It supports efficient branching and merging, allowing developers to work on features independently before integrating changes.
	3.	Transparency: Detailed commit history ensures clear traceability of changes, improving accountability.
	4.	Integration: GitHub integrates with CI/CD pipelines, project management tools, and IDEs for seamless workflows.
	5.	Backup and Hosting: The remote repository on GitHub provides reliable backup and accessibility from anywhere.

Disadvantages of GitHub
	1.	Learning Curve: For beginners, Git commands and GitHub workflows can be complex to understand.
	2.	Internet Dependency: Remote repository access requires an internet connection, which can be a limitation in offline scenarios.
	3.	Cost for Private Repositories: While GitHub offers free repositories, advanced features and larger storage may require a paid subscription for teams.
	4.	Conflict Management: Merge conflicts can arise in collaborative projects, requiring careful resolution.
